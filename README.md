- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicolás Nahuel Moreyra (@niconm89)

- 🧬💻 I’m a PhD bioinformatician working at the intersection of genomics, data science, and AI-enabled biotech R&D.

- 🧠 My work focuses on omics data analysis, comparative genomics, genome and transcriptome assembly, phylogenomics, and biological interpretation of complex datasets.

- ⚙️ I design reproducible, scalable bioinformatics workflows and analytical tools to support R&D decision-making in biotech and health-tech contexts.

- 🤖 I’m particularly interested in applying machine learning and AI approaches to biological data integration and experimental prioritization.

- 🤝 Open to collaborations and consulting projects in biotech, genomics, and applied AI.
